 * Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n
 * which divide evenly into n).
 * If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and
 * each of a and b are called amicable numbers.
 * 
 * For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44,
 * 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4,
 * 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.
 * 
 * Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
 * 
 * COMPLETED ON 20/05/18
 * 
 * METHOD 1 works, but gets a little hard on the processor when working with big
 * numbers (>100.000), as it calls the dn() function twice.
 * METHOD 2, on the other hand, calls dn() once for every value and stores it in
 * an array. This saves processing time, but uses more memory.
