 * You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some
 * research for yourself.
 * 
 * - 1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
 * 
 * - Thirty days has September,
 * April, June and November.
 * All the rest have thirty-one,
 * Saving February alone,
 * Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
 * And on leap years, twenty-nine.
 * 
 * - A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century
 * unless it is divisible by 400.
 * 
 * How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century
 * (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
 * 
 * COMPLETED ON 19/05/18
 * 
 * I know there's probably a cleverer way to do this, but I did use this method
 * because not only it can do what is meant to in the problem, but can also
 * return the total sundaysCount in the 20th century.
